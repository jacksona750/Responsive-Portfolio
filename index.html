      <p>I'm a holistic bodyworker, nutritionist and web development student here to share my unique flare!</p>

      <p>I grew up in Seattle, but have dreamed of living in Southern California for as long as I can remember. I moved to Santa Monica in the Spring of 2017 and have never looked back! I love being outdoors and active and the opportunites for that are endless here. When not working, I'm either hiking in the mountains, exploring new areas and seeking adventures OR nerding out playing tetris, doing a jigsaw puzzle or working on my latest web project.</p>

      <p>Check out my portfolio to see what I've been up to!</p>
